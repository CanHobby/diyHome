DIY Home Automation using ESPnow inspired by Home Assistant

This is my attempt at making a Home Assistant home automation system grared to the Arduinno DIY user.  It is less bulky and easir to configure than HA.  It is (or will be) a fairly complex project involving mostly Arduino ".ino" files, but does include HTML and ".css" etc.

My goal is to make it as modular as possible, AND to include lots of comments - BOTH in the code and where applicable in the README files in each major subdiretory.

I make the assumption that you know how to use the Arduino IDE to compile and upload code.

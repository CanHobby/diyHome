DIY Home Automation using ESPnow inspired by Home Assistant

This is my attempt at making a Home Assistant home automation system grared to the Arduinno DIY user.  It is less bulky and easir to configure than HA.  It is (or will be) a fairly complex project involving mostly Arduino ".ino" files, but does include HTML and ".css" etc.

My goal is to make it as modular as possible
